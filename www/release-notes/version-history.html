<div class="pane" id="tools">

	<h3 class="first"><em>October 08 / 2009</em> Version 1.1.2</h3>

	<p>
		The event object has been extended to have a lot more information. Here is an example:
	</p>

	<pii:code>
	$("#scroll").scrollable().onSeek(function(event, index) {

		// mouse position at the time when the event was fired
		var x = event.pageX;
		var y = event.pageY;

		// whether CTRL, ALT, SHIFT or ESC was being pressed
		var alt = event.altKey,
			ctrl = event.ctrlKey,
			shift = event.shiftMey,
			esc = event.metaKey;


		// the original triggering element
		var element = e.originalTarget || e.srcElement;

	});
	</pii:code>


	<h3><em>June 07 / 2009</em>: Version 1.1.1.</h3>

	<p>
		In jQuery Tools version 1.1.1. the event processing is standardized according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-flow-cancelation" class="external">W3C standards</a>. This is good news for advanced scripters - the users who want to extend the default behaviour of the tools and for the jQuery Tools plugin developers. Here is what you can do with it:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Add and <em>remove</em> your existing callback functions.</li>
		<li>Specify a name for your callbacks and later remove only those named callbacks.</li>
		<li>Specify a single callback for multiple event types.</li>
		<li>
			If you have multiple callbacks of the same type you can prevent the rest of the callbacks from being executed.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		You can read the details of the new event model in the <a href="${jqt}/using.html#callbacks">User's Manual</a>.
	</p>


	<h3><em> September 11 / 2009</em>: Version 1.1.0.</h3>

	<p>
		A new global variable <samp>$.tools</samp> which has following kind of tree structure:
	</p>

	<p style="margin:20px 0">
		<img src="img/global-config.gif" alt="Global configuration" />
	</p>

	<p>
		This shows the available tools, effects, plugins and their versions and <a href="${jqt}/using.html#global_configuration">global configurations</a>
	</p>

	<h3><em> June 03 / 2009</em> Version 1.0.0. (Initial release)</h3>

	<p>
		Former well known jQuery plugins:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>jquery.scrollable</li>
		<li>jquery.overlay</li>
		<li>jquery.expose</li>
		<li>flashembed</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Are now packaged into single library called <strong>jquery.tools</strong> with a new prefix and version number as follows:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>tools.scrollable</li>
		<li>tools.overlay</li>
		<li>tools.expose</li>
		<li>tools.flashembed</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		The library also contains the following new tools:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>tools.tabs</li>
		<li>tools.tooltip</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		making the library complete.
	</p>

	<a name="common"></a>
	<h4>Common changes to all tools</h4>

	<p>
		Here is a list of the changes that are common for all tools:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			All tools are now minified with Yahoo's <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/" class="external">YUICompressor</a> which is designed to be 100% safe and yield a higher compression ratio than most other tools. <a href="http://www.jslint.com/" class="external">JSLint</a> is still used for verifying the code quality.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>plugin architecture</strong> - which essentially means that you are allowed to assign multiple callback methods for same event. Look for more information here about <a href="${jqt}/using.html#plugins">writing plugins</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <samp>getVersion</samp> method has been removed and now you get access to the individual tool version through the global <samp>$.tools.version</samp> object. For example, <samp>$.tools.version.tabs</samp>, will return the version for the tabs tool.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <samp>alert</samp> configuration variable has been removed. Alert boxes are no longer used when an exception is thrown in a custom callback method. Errors are printed in the browser's JavaScript console or Firebug.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new <samp>api</samp> flag that you use to return the tools programming API when the tool is constructed. Look for more information here about <a href="${jqt}/using.html#api">accessing the API</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<!--}}}-->


<!--{{{ scrollable -->

<a name="scrollable"></a>
<div class="pane" id="scrollable">

	<h3 class="first">1.1.2. <em>October 08 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			new <samp>onStart</samp> callback function which is triggered just before the items start scrolling. This happens between <samp>onBeforeSeek</samp> and <samp>onBeforeSeek</samp> events. All API methods rely on the fact that the scollable is already on it's target position. By returning <samp>false</samp> inside this function you can prevent the disabling of the navigational elements.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ability to change the speed inside <samp>onBeforeSeek</samp> event. Thanks <a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/forum/35/27451">blacktrash</a></li>
		<li>index argument is supplied for the callback functions that are given to seeking functions as an argument</li>
		<li>
			next and nextPage buttons are now disabled when item count is less than the scrollable size
			thanks <a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/forum/35/27359">sb3den</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h4>navigator plugin</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>
			new configuration variable <samp>idPrefix</samp> which generates ID- attribute for each item so that they can be uniquely styled with CSS. For example value "foo" generated ID:s "foo0", "foo1", "foo2" and so on. </li>
		<li>
			active class is assigned upon the new <samp>onStart</samp> event so that the navigator behaviour is more visually  pleasing
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>1.1.1. <em>September 17 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>fixed a bug where the <samp>reload()</samp> call broke an existing keyboard navigation feature</li>

		<li>added the <samp>getClickIndex()</samp> method to the API</li>
		<li>fixed a bug where the <samp>onBeforeSeek</samp> and <samp>onSeek</samp> callbacks were called although the seeking position did not change. this won't happen anymore.</li>
		<li>brought back the <samp>loop</samp> variable</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>1.1.0. <em> September 11 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>possible to seek with zero (0) speed	 </li>
		<li>possibility to scroll with one sized scrollable by clicking. the direction changes whe beginning or end is reached or navigational buttons are used in which case the scrolling goes to the same direction as the latest seek. </li>
		<li>new method <samp>getNaviButtons</samp>	</li>
		<li>new event: <samp>onReload</samp>  </li>
		<li>navigational elements can be placed anywhere on the page. If you have multiple scrollables on your page you should read about <a href="${jqt}/scrollable.html#multiple">multiple scrollables with navigational element</a>
		</li>
		<li>keyboard arrow keys now advance the same amount as the page size. can be changed with a new configuration option: <samp>keyboardSteps</samp> </li>
		<li>keyboard functionality can now be dynamically disabled/enabled by setting <samp>getConf().keyboard</samp> flag and calling <samp>reload()</samp> after that. See this <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/3/23142#post-23163">forum thread</a> for details.</li>
		<li>fixed a bug where you could not seek to an item who's index is higher than the index of the first item of the last page. this caused a quite lengthy discussion found <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/20/22384">here</a></li>
		<li>new "item" configuration property that lets you filter only some of the child elements as scrollable items </li>
		<li>if <samp>clickable</samp> property is enabled then <samp>A</samp>- tags inside scrollable won't scroll forward	</li>
		<li>
			new <samp>keyboard: 'static'</samp> configuration option makes the scrollable instance always controllable by the keyboard arrow keys. The scrollable does not have to be actively used.
		</li>
		<li>
			new <samp>focus()</samp> method: after this call the keyboard arrow keys will control this particular scrollable instance. You can take a look at <a href="${jqt}/demos/scrollable/site-navigation.html">A complete scrollable navigational system</a> demo which takes advantage of the "static" value and the <samp>focus()</samp> method.
		</li>
		<li>
			<samp>onSeek</samp> callback method is truly triggered *after* the scrolling animation.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>New plugins for Scrollable</h4>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/scrollable.html#circular">circular 1.0.0</a> </li>
		<li><a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/scrollable.html#autoscroll">autoscroll 1.0.0</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/scrollable.html#navigator">navigator 1.0.0</a>		</li>
		<li><a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/scrollable.html#mousewheel">mousewheel 1.0.0</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		mousewheel plugin is based on Three Dub Media's <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/wheel" class="external">wheel plugin</a> which is a smaller, simplified interpretation of Brandon Aaron's special event "Mouse Wheel Extension"
	</p>

	<h3>1.0.5 <em> June 12 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Using a zero (<samp>0</samp>) on the scrolling animation caused to use the default speed (400ms). Now zero speed is possible.
		</li>
		<li>
			When autoScroll was enabled and it was programmatically paused this caused multiple timers to be created. this was spotted in <a href="http://www.flowplayer.org/forum/20/20923">this thread</a>. Autoscroll is now concidered as a depcreated feature and it will be replaced by an "autoscroll plguin" for scrollable scrollable 1.2.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>1.0.4 <em> June 08 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Updated the graphics package. <a href="${jqt}/demos/scrollable/vertical.htm">vertical scrollable</a> has a new "skin"</li>
		<li>
			Fixed a bug where the Alt-left and Alt-right browser keystrokes fails to navigate backwards and forwards between pages. Now when the Alt or Control keys are pressed, the arrow keypresses are ignored. See details from this <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/20/20384">forum thread</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>1.0.3 <em> June 03 / 2009</em></h3>

		<li>All changes that are <a href="#tools">common to each tool</a></li>
		<li>Navigational elements can be other than siblings. The problem was spotted from this <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/8/18620">forum thread</a>.</li>
		<li>Support for varying width items in scrollable. Thanks to "rpitting" who posted <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/8/15544">a solution</a> </li>
		<li>Next and prev actions now work on <a href="${jqt}/demos/scrollable/vertical.htm?size=2">two sized scrollables</a></li>
		<li>Automatic scrolling can be stopped at runtime by calling: getConf().interval = 0. See this <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/8/14620">forum thread</a>.</li>
		<li>Clicking on the last items was working inconsistently. Thanks to "xeshm" who suggested <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/8/16894">a solution</a>.</li>
		<li>The arrow keys are now working in IE and Chrome</li>
	</ul>

		<li>a whole new <a href="${jqt}/scrollable.html#api">API</a> for interacting with scrollable. </li>
		<li><samp>getConf()</samp> method that you can read <em>and modify</em> for making the tool behave differently at runtime</li>
		<li><samp>easing</samp> configuration option for changing how scrolling animation behaves. two options "swing" and "linear"	</li>
		<li>all seeking funktions in an api accept optional callback function that is triggered when seeking finished. this happens after <samp>onBeforeSeek</samp> and before <samp>onSeek</samp> events.</li>
		<li><samp>keyboard</samp> option to enable/disable navigation with arrow keys</li>
		<li>error handling on callback functions</li>
		<li><samp>alert</samp> configuration option to enable/disable alert boxes when you have erroneous code in your callbacks</li>

		<li>
			<samp>top</samp> configuration variable now accepts percentage values so that it works better in different kind of screen resolitions. By default this is 10%
		</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Optional event object can be given as argument to load(), close() functions and it will be handled to the callback functions. A convenient way to pass data for the callbacks.	</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>1.0.4. <em> September 11 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			A complex function for calculating the mask size properly for every browser / version combination is (hopefully) completed. There are many complexities that are mainly involved with the fact that is the scrollbar visible or not. IE is of course the hardest to get in shape. Again <a href="http://www.bringdownie6.com/" class="external">It's time to Unite</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new method <samp>fit()</samp> which will resize the mask to fill the whole space. This is needed if you grow the document size yourself. Look at <a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/demos/expose/styling.html">this demo</a> for an example of this method.

		<li>the biggest rewrite for the tools. most notably this tool is not a "singleton" anymore - meaning that you can now initialize multiple exposes on the page with different settings and load/close their exposing state separately. this is on the same line with the functionality with other tools.</li>
		<li>different mask settings are possible for different elements</li>
		<li>lazy loading of the effect. you now initialize the expose beforehand and later call <samp>load</samp></li>
		<li>takes all the available room on the browser window (no inconsistency on browsers)</li>
		<li>no additional scrollbars available when exposing effect is in place</li>
		<li>if window is resized the mask size is adjusted accordingly: look for following <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/8/13938">forum thread</a>.</li>
		<li>in this version the <samp>maskId</samp> variable is null by default. this may break other installations if they have tweaked the <samp>#exposeMask</samp> element with custom CSS settings. this can be fixed by setting <samp>maskId</samp> back to "exposeMask". </li>
		<li>new default color for the mask: #456 </li>
		<li><samp>closeOnEsc</samp> configuration variable</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Changes to old installations</h4>

	<p>
		This release will break old installations. Here is how things were configured in previous version.
	</p>

	<pii:code>
	// expose elements
	$("div.myElements").expose();

	// close exposing
	$.exopse.close();
	</pii:code>

	<p>
		In this version the same thing is achieved in following manner
	</p>

	<pii:code>
	// expose elements
	var api = $("div.myElements").expose({api: true}).load();

	// close exposing
	api.close();
	</pii:code>

	<p>
		This is because now there can be multiple exposes on the page simultaneously and the behaviour is on the line with other tools. If you are exposing overlays you can now use the <samp>expose</samp> <a href="overlay.html#configuration">configuration variable</a> which will make your life much easier.
	</p>


	<h3>1.0.1 <em>Apr 15 2009</em></h3>

	<p>
		Z-index was not restored to their original value when exposing was closed.
	</p>

	<h3>1.0.0 <em>Feb 16 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>totally rewritten source code and a new <a href="${jqt}/expose.html#api">JavaScript API</a></li>
		<li>ability to trigger expose programmatically</li>
		<li>new callback functions: <samp>onBeforeLoad</samp>, <samp>onLoad</samp> abd <samp>onBeforeClose</samp></li>
		<li>inside every callback function <samp>this</samp>- varialbe is a pointer to the API</li>
		<li><samp>$.expose</samp> is a pointer to the currently or previously active expose API</li>
		<li>new configuration options: <samp>maskId, zIndex, loadSpeed, closeSpeed</samp> and <samp>alert</samp></li>
		<li>a new <a href="${jqt}/demos/expose">expose demo section</a></li>
	</ul>


	<h3>0.13 <em>Nov 5</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li><samp>onBlur</samp> name changed to <samp>onClose</samp> - consistent with other tools</li>
		<li>
			made expose work so that it can work in co-operation with <samp>overlay</samp> tool. example of such co-operation can be found <a href="/demos/overlay.htm">here</a>.
		</li>
		<li>absolutely positioned elements were re-positioned relatively. this no longer happens.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>0.12 <em>Oct 31, 2008</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>unexpose function</li>
		<li>onBlur option</li>

<a name="tabs"></a>
<div class="pane" id="tabs">

	<h3 class="first">1.0.4. <em>October 08 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			only performs an initial <samp>click()</samp> call when <samp>initialIndex</samp> is a positive number. possibility to initialize tabs so that all tabs are hidden
		</li>
		<li>
			fixed a bug where <samp>getCurrentPane()</samp> did not return anything althought a proper <samp>initialIndex</samp> was specified.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>1.0.3. <em>September 17 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			panes can be specified as a jQuery object. See this <a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/forum/25/26677">forum thread</a>.</li>
		<li><strong>tabs.history</strong> now works with the tabs <samp>initialIndex</samp> option</li>
		<li><strong>tabs.slideshow</strong> now stops working after the first iteration when <samp>autoplay</samp> is enabled</li>
		<li><strong>tabs.slideshow</strong> added the <samp>onBeforePlay</samp>, <samp>onPlay</samp>, <samp>onBeforePause</samp>, <samp>onPause</samp> events</li>
		<li>
			<strong>tabs.history</strong> no more error messages on IE6 when being used together with the HTTPS protocol. See this <a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/forum/25/26592">forum thread</a></li>
		<li>
	</li>

	<h3 class="first">1.0.2. <em> September 11 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>new built-in effect: "ajax" </li>
		<li>a new configuration property <samp>fadeOutSpeed</samp> for the "fade" effect for performing "crossfades"</li>
		<li>new <samp>rotate</samp> configuration property for cycling through the tabs in a circular manner</li>
		<li>
			<samp>history</samp> option is now implemented as a plugin. It has changed to <samp>$("..").tabs().history();</samp>. This new plugin handles history even better. No more unnessessary IFRAME hacks for IE8.
		</li>
		<li><samp>$.tools.addTabEffect()</samp> is no longer used for adding new custom effects. Use <samp>$.tools.tabs.addEffect()</samp> instead</li>
		<li>fixed a bug where the last tab was opened if there was an unidentified hash value on the URL</li>
		<li>
			<samp>onClick</samp> event is called after the effect has *really* finished it's job. If the effect has animations the event is called <em>after</em> the animation has been finished. If you have made your own effects for tabs the implementation has <a href="tabs.html#effects">changed a bit</a>. Look for the <samp>done</samp> argument.
		</li>
		<li>
			The ability to instantiate multiple tabs or accordions <a href="${jqt}/demos/tabs/multiple.html">with a single call</a>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>New plugins for Tabs</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>

<!--{{{ tooltip -->

<a name="tooltip"></a>
<div class="pane" id="tooltip">

	<h3 class="first">1.1.2. <em>Oct 08 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			you can specify whether the tooltip closes upon <samp>mouseout</samp> or not. In fact you can configure the opening and closing event for the tooltip element. this happens with the new <samp>effects.tooltip</samp> configuration option.
		</li>
		<li>
			tooltip works flawlessly with animated effects when being quickly moved from trigger to another. this was especially present in the <a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/demos/tooltip/form.html">form demo</a> which now works smoothly.
		</li>
		<li>
			fixed "black box" PNG bug in toggle effect for Internet Explorer
		</li>
		<li>
			fixed a bug where <samp>this.getTrigger()</samp> may return a the tooltip element inside callbacks when the tooltip was being hidden by moving the mouse out of the tooltip.
		</li>
		<li>
			when an effect is not found a proper error message is thrown: <em>Nonexistent effect "myeffect"</em>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>1.1.1. <em>September 17 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>tooltip</strong> ability to change the tooltip dynamically by setting: <samp>trigger.data("title", title)</samp>. See this <a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/forum/30/26527">forum thread</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>tooltip</strong> by default the tooltip position is now determined by using the <samp>offset()</samp> method of jQuery. This gives better results when the trigger is positioned inside relatively or absolutely positioned elements. See <a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/forum/30/26424">this</a> and <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/users/15251">this</a> forum threads. Thanks "bericum".
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>tooltip</strong> the <samp>relative</samp> configuration property can be used to switch between positioning schemes. Using <samp>false</samp> positions the tooltip relative to the document and using <samp>true</samp> positions the tooltip relative to the parent element. you should rarely need to touch this property.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>tooltip</strong> when calling the <samp>hide</samp> API method the <samp>delay</samp> configuration variable is ignored and the tip will be hidden immediately. thanks <a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/forum/30/27002">Aramaki</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>1.1.0. <em> September 11 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>If opacity is set to 1 it is not set at all. This caused "black box" problems in IE</li>
		<li>new <samp>lazy</samp> configuration variable which will make the pages load faster when there are many tooltips. This is enabled by default when there is more than 20 tooltips on the page. For the record, 21 triggers this will cause 2336 calls and takes 169.144ms with fast computers.	</li>
		<li>trigger's <samp>title</samp> attribute can be used as the tooltip. This requires that the <samp>tip</samp> configuration variable is given. </li>
		<li><samp>onBeforeShow</samp> is now fed with position argument this usable for plugin developers	</li>
		<li>if <samp>delay</samp> is set to 0 it is now truly 0 (as opposed to a 1 millisecond setTimeout call);</li>
		<li>new configuration option: <samp>predelay</samp> for enabling delays <em>before</em> the tooltip is shown</li>
		<li>new effects are no longer added with <samp>$.tools.addTipEffect()</samp> but with <samp>$.tools.tooltip.addEffect()</samp> instead</li>
		<li>a much simpler syntax for the <samp>position</samp> parameter. It can now be given as a string such as <samp>"top center"</samp>. The old syntax, <samp>['top', 'center']</samp>, is still supported </li>
		<li><samp>onHide</samp> and <samp>onShow</samp> events are now called as the very last event after the possible animation </li>
		<li>default effect "slideup" is now replaced with a highly configurable "slide" effect</li>
		<li>new configuration properties for the "slide" effect: <samp>direction</samp> specifies the sliding direction and <samp>bounce</samp> specifies whether the sliding comes back to the opposite direction from the original direction.</li>
		<li>new <samp>cancelDefault</samp> configuration property for removing the browser's default tooltip. The original <samp>title</samp> attribute can still be retrieved with <samp>trigger.data("title")</samp></li>
		<li>when tooltip is used together with form fields the tooltip will not be hidden when mouse leaves it</li>
		<li>
			A completely new <a href="${jqt}/tooltip.html#events">event management system</a> where you can fully control <em>when</em> the tooltip will be shown or hidden. Thanks to forum posts: <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/20/24023">this</a> and <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/20/23020">this</a> for the idea.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Dynamic plugin 1.0.0</h4>

	<p>
		A new Tooltip plugin for automatically repositioing the tooltip based on the document's scrolling position. The tooltip will always stay visible. See the details of <a href="http://flowplayer.org${jqt}/tooltip.html#dynamic">here</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>1.0.2 <em> June 12 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			fixed a bug where trigger could change when it had child elements - such as table. see <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/20/20772">forum thread</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			tooltip now closes when mouse leaves the tip while it's still being animated. see <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/20/20635#post-20793">forum thread</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			new build-in effect: "fade" with two configuration variables: <samp>fadeInSpeed</samp>, <samp>fadeOutSpeed</samp>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>1.0.1 <em> June 08 / 2009</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Tooltip is initialized differently. Instead of selecting the tooltip we are selecting the triggering element. Look for <a href="${jqt}/demos/tooltip/index.html">minimal setup for tooltip</a> for the details.
		</li>
		<li>
			tooltips now work correclty on textareas. see details from this <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/20/20480">forum thread</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			tooltip can be positioned next to the trigger element's parent too. this is sometimes needed in forms for example. the input is nested inside a <samp>label</samp> element and the tooltip is placed next to the label. See details from this <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/20/20510">forum thread</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>1.0.0 <em> June 03 / 2009</em></h3>

	<h3 class="first">1.0.4. <em> Setptember 11 / 2009</em></h3>

	<p>
		New configuration property <samp>cachebusting</samp> which will force the SWF file to be loaded from the cache no matter what the expiry headers are. This is achieved by appending a random query string variable on the request URL. This property is <samp>false</samp> by default. Thanks to the following <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/20/21090#post-21999">forum thread</a>.

	<h3>1.0.1 <em>February 24, 2009</em></h3>

	<p>
	Fixed a bug on IE when embedding is done inside the <samp>A</samp> tag and an unsupported Flash version was detected. It seems that IE will throw a JavaScript error when additional A tag is placed inside existing A tag by scripting.
	</p>

	<h3>1.0.0 <em>February 4, 2009</em></h3>

	<p>
		This version can now be used to embed all kinds of Flash objects and some problems encountered on the previous release has been resolved.
	</p>

	<p>
		A large collection of <a href="${jqt}/demos/flashembed/index.html">flashembed demos</a> showing you the flexibility of this tool. demos include: basics, jquery usage, handling old versions, layering HTML on top of Flash.

	</ul>

	<h3>0.31 <em>July 220, 2008</em></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>flashembed() can insert flash into page even thougt DOM has not been loaded yet. it incorporates an internal DOM checking utility. this way nested OBJECT's API is not returned and so it's designed to be used in simple embedding.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug on Safari when no flashvars was given.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug on IE where an id is required for object tag in order to access it's public API.</li>
