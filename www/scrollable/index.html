</div>

<p>
	Besides clicking on the tabs you can also scroll through the elements:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Clicking on the content area</li>
	<li>Clicking on the action buttons below the scrollable</li>
	<li>Using the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard</li>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>
	There are many other ways of using this tool than can be illustrated in the demos provided here. It is important to realize that elements being setup for scrolling can contain <strong>any</strong> HTML: text, images, forms, Flash objects, or any combination of the above.
</p>
<p>
	The tool is always initialized by means of a JavaScript call similar to the following:
</p>

<pii:code>
// select one or more elements to be scrollable-enabled
$("JQUERY SELECTOR").scrollable({

	// one configuration property
	size: 5,

	// ... the rest of the configuration properties
});
</pii:code>


<p>
	Here is a list of all available configuration options:
</p>

<table class="listing">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Property</th>
			<th nowrap>Default value</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>

	<tr>
		<td class="code">activeClass</td>
		<td><code>"active"</code></td>
		<td>
			The CSS class name for a clicked scrollable item. Only valid if you have enabled the <samp>clickable</samp> property.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">api</td>
		<td><code>false</code></td>
		<td>
			When this tool is initialized (constructed), the return value is a jQuery object associated with the selector. By setting this property to <samp>true</samp>, the return value is this tool's <a href="#api">JavaScript API</a> instead. If the selector returns multiple elements, the API of the <em>last</em> element will be returned. Read more about <a href="${jqt}/using.html#api">accessing the tool API</a> for more information.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">clickable</td>
		<td><code>true</code></td>
		<td>
			Whether scrolling occurs when an item is clicked inside the scrollable-enabled element. The clicked element is positioned In the center of the scrollable and it is assigned a CSS class name specified in the <samp>activeClass</samp> configuration property. You can get the index number of the clicked item with the <samp>getClickIndex()</samp> API call. Note that the <samp>getIndex</samp> method will <em>not</em> return the index number of the clicked element. It can differ from the seek position.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">disabledClass</td>
		<td><code>"disabled"</code></td>
		<td>
			The CSS class name for disabled <samp>next</samp>/<samp>nextPage</samp> and <samp>prev</samp>/<samp>prevPage</samp> elements. For example, the <samp>prev</samp> element is disabled when there are no previous items to scroll to. Typically you assign <samp>visibility: 'hidden'</samp> CSS definition for disabled elements.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">easing</td>
		<td><code>"swing"</code></td>
		<td>
			The type of "easing" applied to the scrolling animation. 'swing' means that there is an acceleration, followed by a constant speed, followed by a deceleration. 'linear' means that the whole animation happens at a constant speed. You can also make your <a href="demos/scrollable/easing.html">own easing effects</a>.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">globalNav</td>
		<td><code>false</code></td>
		<td>
			 By default the navigational elements needs to have a <a href="#multiple">mutual wrapper element</a> with the scrollable itself. Enable this variable if your navigational elements are not placed under the the same parent element than the scrollable so that they can be found.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">hoverClass</td>
		<td><code></code></td>
		<td>
			The CSS class name for the scrollable item which has a mouse pointer over it.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">items</td>
		<td><code>".items"</code></td>
		<td>
			The scrollable root element is not directly used as a parent for the scrollable items. The root must have one nested element that contains the actual items. By default scrollable uses the <em>first and only element</em> inside the root to be used as a wrapper for the items. It does not have to have any particular CSS class name. A simple DIV is fine.

			<p>
				If you for some reason have multiple elements inside the root element, then scrollable looks for the element specified by this property. By default an element with the class name "items" is used, but you can use any jQuery selector you like in this property.
			</p>

			<p>
				See <a href="demos/scrollable/">minimal setup</a> for an undertanding of the HTML setup for scrollable.
			</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">item</td>
		<td><code></code></td>
		<td>
			If you have different kinds of items under the <samp>items</samp> element and you only want some of them to work as scrollable items then you can use this parameter to select only those specific items. This is a jQuery selector and typically a tag name such as "div" is enough to select the correct items.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">keyboard</td>
		<td><code>true</code></td>
		<td>
			Whether or not keyboard arrow key navigation is enabled. The horizontal scroller moves backwards/forwards with the left/right arrow keys; the vertical scroller moves with the up/down keys. The arrow keys are valid for the scrollable that was used most recently. Since version 1.1.0 you can also supply the value <samp>'static'</samp> here which means that the scrollable is always controlled with the arrow keys and it does not have to be active.

			<p>
				You can also use the <samp>focus()</samp> method to specify the focus to a certain scrollable on the page. You can take a look at the <a href="demos/scrollable/site-navigation.html">A complete scrollable navigational system</a> demo which takes advantage of the "static" value and the <samp>focus()</samp> method.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you want to disable the keyboard for a particular scrollable, you can call for example:
			</p>

<pii:code>
// grab second scrollabe and it's API
var instance = $(".horizontal").eq(1).scrollable();

// disable keyboard
instance.getConf().keyboard = false;

// reload is required
instance.reload();

<h3>Multiple scrollables and <em>next/prev/nextPage/prevPage</em> actions</h3>

<p>
	If you have multiple scrollables on your page we need to make sure that each navigational element is controlling the right scrollable instance. Let's say we have following call to instantiate multiple scrollables with their own "next" and "prev" elements.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to instantiate multiple scrollables with the same call. For example, if you have multiple scrollable root elements with the CSS class name "vertical" they can all be instantiated with this:
</p>

<pii:code>
$(".vertical").scrollable();
</pii:code>

<p>
	Now each of the scrollable uses the default selectors <samp>.next</samp> and <samp>.next</samp> to look for the navigational elements causing multiple elements to be returned. How do we know which navigational element controls which scrollable? The problem can be solved by enclosing each scrollable <em>and</em> it's navigational actions inside a mutual wrapper element. For example:
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
<!-- 1st scrollable and it's navigational actions are wrapped inside an extra DIV -->
<div>
	<a class="next"/>
	<div class="scrollable">
		...
	</div>
	<a class="next"/>
</div>

<!-- 2nd instance -->
<div>
	<a class="next"/>
	<div class="scrollable">
		...
	</div>
	<a class="next"/>
</div>
</pii:code>


<a name="callbacks"></a>
<h3>Using callback functions</h3>

<p>
	Here is an example of an <samp>onSeek</samp> callback function. Inside any callback function the <samp>this</samp> variable is a pointer to the scrollable scripting API.
</p>

<pii:code>
$("div.scrollable").scrollable({
	onSeek: function() {
		alert("current page is " + this.getPageIndex());
	},

	// another configuration variable as an example
	clickable: false

});
</pii:code>

<p>
	See the <a href="using.html#callbacks">Using Callback Functions</a> section of the User's Guide for a more detailed description about this important topic.
</p>


<a name="api"></a>
<h2>Scripting <em>API</em></h2>

<p>
	scrollable has a clean and well-designed API for scripters, with which it is possible to enrich the scrolling user experience. You can get a handle to the API in numerous ways as described in the <a href="using.html#api">User's Manual</a>. Here is an example of how to access the API:
</p>

<pii:code>
// get handle to the API upon initialization
var api = $("div.scrollable").scrollable({api: true});

// perform a simple API call
api.next();

// register a callback function
api.onSeek(function() {

	// here, the 'this' variable points to the API
	this.getPageIndex();

});

// supply a callback function to a regular API call
api.next(function() {

	// again the 'this' variable points to the API
	this.prev();

});
</pii:code>

<h3 style="margin-top:15px">Arguments and return value</h3>

<p>
	All seeking methods (the methods from <samp>prev</samp> onwards in the above list) accept two additional, optional arguments:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<samp>speed</samp> this argument is used to specify how long (in milliseconds) the scrolling animation lasts. This overrides the <samp>speed</samp> property specified in the configuration.
	</li>
	<li>
		<samp>callback</samp> this argument is used to specify a function to be called when the scrolling animation finishes. This function is called <em>before</em> the <samp>onSeek</samp> function and it runs only once (as opposed to <samp>onBeforeSeek</samp> and <samp>onSeek</samp>, which are called every time a scolling animation takes place).
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Seeking methods always return the current scrollable instance, so you can chain method calls as follows:
</p>

<pii:code>
// a method chaining example
$("div.scrollable").scrollable().click(0).seekTo(2, 3000, function() {
	this.getConf().easing = 'linear';
	this.end();
});
</pii:code>

<p>
	Although this example probably doesn't represent a real world scenario, it is a good demonstration, and it will work if you try executing it in the Firebug console on the example on this page.
