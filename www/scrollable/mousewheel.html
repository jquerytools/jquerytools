<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
	Here is the JavaScript setup:

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>
	Here is a full list of available configuration options:
</p>


<table class="listing">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>property</th>
			<th>default</th>
			<th>description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">api</td>
		<td><code>false</code></td>
		<td>
			When the scrollable and its chained plugins are initialized (constructed), the return value is a jQuery object associated with the selector. By setting this property to <samp>true</samp>, the return value is this tool's <a href="#api">JavaScript API</a> instead. If the selector returns multiple elements, the API of the <em>last</em> element will be returned. The <samp>api</samp> property must be added to the <em>last</em> plugin in the initialization chain. Read more about <a href="${jqt}/using.html#api">accessing the tool API</a> for more information.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="code">speed</td>
		<td><code>50</code></td>
		<td>
			The scrolling speed on each mousewheel "step". If this is the only configuration variable for this plugin you can give the speed value directly for the mousewheel plugin. For example: <samp>$("#scroller").scrollable().mousewheel(100);</samp>
		</td>
	</tr>

<h3>The wheel plugin</h3>

<p>
	This plugin is based on Three Dub Media's <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/wheel">wheel plugin</a> which is a smaller, simplified interpretation of the Brandon Aaron's well-known special event, "Mouse Wheel Extension". Thank you! If you have downloaded the mousewheel plugin this wheel plugin is also ready to be used as a standalone tool. Here is how you can use it:
</p>

<pii:code>
// make #myelement listen to mousewheel events
$("#myelement").wheel(function(event, delta) {

});
</pii:code>

<p>
	Whenever the mousewheel is used with the selector element, the supplied function is called. It is fed with two arguments. The first one is the jQuery <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Event" class="external">event object</a> and the second one specifies how much the wheel was rotated. A positive value for <samp>delta</samp> means movement downwards and a negative value means movement upwards.
