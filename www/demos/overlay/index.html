	Below you can see two images that launch overlays. There are two terms being used: the <strong>trigger</strong> is the element that launches the overlay and the <strong>overlay</strong> is the element that is being positioned on top of the page.
</p>

<%@ include file="index.htm" %>

<h3>HTML code for the <em>triggers</em></h3>

<p>
	First we define triggers as follows:
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
<img src="thumbs/barcelona-pavilion.jpg" rel="#mies1"/>
<img src="thumbs/barcelona-pavilion2.jpg" rel="#mies2"/>
</pii:code>

<p>
	These triggers have a reference to the overlay element in the <samp>rel</samp> attribute. This attribute is a <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors" class="external">jQuery selector</a> that selects the overlay being used. A typical selector selects one element that has a unique <samp>id</samp>. <samp>#mies1</samp> selects an element that has an <samp>id</samp> of "mies1".
</p>

<p>
	You can have one or many triggers on the page and each can reference the same or different overlays
</p>

<p>
	Note that we used a <samp>BUTTON</samp> tag here but you can use any element as a trigger as long as it has the <samp>rel</samp> attribute. A typical scenario is to use <samp>A</samp> tag with the <samp>rel</samp> attribute and a nested <samp>IMG</samp> tag.
</p>

<h3>HTML code for <em>overlays</em></h3>

<p>
	Now we need the overlays:
</p>


<pii:code lang="html">
<!-- first overlay. id attribute matches our selector -->
<div class="simple_overlay" id="mies1">

	<!-- large image -->
	<img src="photos/barcelona-pavilion-large.jpg" />

	<!-- image details -->
	<div class="details">
		<h3>The Barcelona Pavilion</h3>

		<h4>Barcelona, Spain</h4>

		<p>The content ...</p>
	</div>

</div>

<!-- second overlay -->
<div class="simple_overlay" id="mies2">
	...
</div>
</pii:code>

<p>
	The overlay can be any HTML elements but the <samp>DIV</samp> is most commonly used. The overlay can contain any HTML including forms, images, Flash objects and JavaScript widgets and it is totally up to you how you structure and style it. This is why this tool is so flexible. It allows you to visualize both the overlay and its content. Just use your imagination.
</p>

<h3>CSS coding</h3>

<p>
	Here is the styling for the overlayed element. There are a couple of things you should note here:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>We have not used any images at all. Everything is pure CSS. This gives us the ability to change the dimensions of the overlay dynamically. The overlay's height is dynamically adjusted to the height of the elements <em>inside</em> the overlay.</li>
	<li>We have used some CSS3 rounded borders and drop shadows. These settings will make the overlay look better in most recent browsers without harming older browsers. This is known as "Progressive Enhancement with CSS".</li>
	<li>We have styled the close button although it is not in our HTML structure. This button is automatically generated by the overlay tool with the class name <samp>close</samp>. You can alter this in the <a href="${jqt}/overlay.html#configuration">configuration</a>.</li>
	<li>You can use <em>absolute positioning</em> of the elements inside the overlay and those elements are positioned relative to the overlay element. This is because the overlay is also absolutely positioned. This is how CSS works.</li>
	<li>
		Since the overlay is absolutely positioned it is in most cases placed on top of the page. However if you have other absolutely (or relatively) positioned elements on the page they may appear over your overlay. You can use the <samp>z-index</samp> parameter to layer your elements properly. An element with a higher <samp>z-index</samp> is placed on top of an element with a lower value.
	</li>
</ul>

<pii:code lang="css">
<%@ include file="${jqt}/css/overlay-basic.css" %>
</pii:code>

<p>
	Here is the simple styling for the <samp>.details</samp> element inside the overlay that shows the description of the image:
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
${css}
</pii:code>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
	This is by far the easiest part of this setup. We simply select the trigger elements and enable overlaying without any additional options:
</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>

<div class="box petrol">
