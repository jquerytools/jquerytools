<p>
	Styling your overlays is easy. Everything can be done with CSS. The thing that affects the look and feel most is the <samp>backgroundImage</samp> property which defines the growing image. Click on these buttons to open different kind overlays:
</p>

<%@ include file="styling.htm" %>


<h3>The setup</h3>

<p>
	The setup is identical to the <a href="index.html">minimal setup</a>, but this time we have multiple buttons and multiple overlays. Each overlay is initialized with this single JavaScript call:
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
${install}
</pii:code>

<h3>Overlays</h3>

<p>
	Each of our overlays has a class <samp>overlay</samp> which defines a common style for each overlay. This common style is taken from this <a href="${jqt}/css/overlay-minimal.css">stylesheet</a>. Each overlay has a unique <samp>id</samp> attribute which is used to customize each overlay separately.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
<!-- first overlay with id "petrol" -->
<div class="overlay" id="petrol">
	.. content ..
</div>

<!-- second overlay with id "custom" -->
<div class="overlay" id="custom">

</div>

<!-- third overlay, background image can, of course, be defined with the style attribute -->
<div class="overlay" id="custom2" style="background-image:url(/img/overlay/flowplayer.png)">

</div>

<!-- rest of the overlays ... -->
</pii:code>

<h3>CSS coding</h3>

<p>
	CSS coding consists of overriding the settings of the default style. This includes customizing the background image and dimensions. Of course, you can use any CSS setting you wish to. CSS is a powerful language.
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
${css}
</pii:code>

<p>
	Note that this tool takes care that the background images are automatically loaded into the browser's cache so that user will see a smooth behaviour although the background image is very big. You can disable this preloading effect from the <a href="${jqt}/overlay.html#configuration">configuration</a>.
</p>

<div class="box petrol">
	Show this demo as a <a href="styling.htm">standalone page</a>.
</div>
