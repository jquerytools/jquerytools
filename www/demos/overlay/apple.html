	Here you can see an <a href="${jqt}/overlay.html#apple">Apple effect</a> in action:
</p>

<c:set var="wrapId" value="apple"/>
<%@ include file="apple.htm" %>

<p>
	Overlaying is done in a visually appealing manner by growing a background image from 0 to the desired size. This differs from "regular" overlaying solutions that do overlaying with static <samp>DIV</samp>s. On the other hand, you are tied to the dimensions of the image. You can change the width but the height scales accordingly so that the aspect ratio remains constant.
</p>

<h3>HTML setup</h3>

<p>
	The HTML setup is identical to the <a href="index.html">minimal setup</a> for overlay. There are trigger elements and their corresponding overlay elements.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
<!-- trigger elements -->
<img src="photos/gustavohouse.jpg" rel="#photo1"/>
<img src="photos/alexanderplatz-station.jpg" rel="#photo2"/>

<!-- overlay for the first trigger. id matches the rel- attribute -->
<div class="overlay black" id="photo1">
	<img src="photos/gustavohouse-medium.jpg" />

	<div class="details">
		<h2>Berlin Gustavohouse</h2>

		<p>
			The Gustavo House in Storkower Strasse. It was built in 1978 and reconstructed in
			1998 by the spanish artist Gustavo.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<!-- overlay for the second trigger -->
<div class="overlay" id="photo2">
	...
</div>
</pii:code>

<h3>CSS coding</h3>

<p>
	Some important things about the CSS coding of this effect:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>This effect requires that your overlay element uses a background image, which is expanded from nothing to the desired size. The background image is defined for the overlay element using the <samp>backgroundImage</samp> CSS property.</li>

	<li>We have styling for the close button although it is not on our HTML structure. This button is automatically generated by the overlay tool with the class name <samp>close</samp>. You can alter this from the configuration.</li>

	<li>The <samp>zIndex</samp> parameter is given in the overlay <a href="${jqt}/overlay.html#apple">configuration</a> and not in the CSS in contrast to the default effect. This parameter is specified for the growing image and the close button and the overlay contents are automatically given a value one greater so they will appear above the background image.
	</li>

	<li>You can use absolute positioning of the elements inside the overlay and those elements are positioned relative to the overlay element. This is because the overlay is also absolutely positioned. This is how CSS works.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	We are using the <a href="${jqt}/css/overlay-apple.css">overlay-apple.css</a> stylesheet which looks like this:
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
<%@ include file="${jqt}/css/overlay-apple.css" %>
</pii:code>

<p>
	You can use any browser-renderable background image with overlay. However, using PNG images allows you to have neat drop shadows in your overlays, since PNG supports <a class="external" href="using.html#png">alpha transparency</a>, while GIF and JPG images do not. You can use the same background image at different sizes without experiencing significant quality degradation.
</p>


<h3>IE6 issues</h3>

<p>
	IE6 does not support alpha-transparency for the overlays so we have used a different background for that browser.
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
${ie6}
</pii:code>

<h3>Black "skin"</h3>

<p>
	You can easily change the look of the overlay simply by changing the background image. In our example above we used black and white backgrounds. For the black overlay we have the class name "black" and it's configuration is here:
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
${css}
</pii:code>


<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
	Here is the overlay configuration. We specify our "apple" effect with the <samp>effect</samp> configuration variable.
</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>

<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> this effect is not included in the standard jQuery Tools distribution. You must download a <a href="${jqt}/download.html#combine">custom combination</a> that includes this effect.
</p>


<div class="box petrol">
	Show this demo as a <a href="apple.htm">standalone page</a>.
</div>

<p>
	<a href="${jqt}/credits.html" id="credits">Photo credits &raquo;</a>
