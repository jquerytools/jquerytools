	Here we have customized the overlay mask with our imaginary corporation's logo. Click on the video and you can see it above the video. We have also customized the close effect on the expose by giving it a fierce magenta colored "flash" effect. Click on the following video and wait for it to finish (or press the ESC key).

<h3>CSS code</h3>

<p>
	By default, the expose tool uses the <samp>id</samp> "exposeMask" for the mask. You can customize it by simply adjusting its CSS properties. Here are our customizations for this demo:
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
${css}
</pii:code>

<h3>HTML code</h3>

<p>
	This time we are exposing our video player and it's the only relevant HTML code. The player is surrounded with an additional box that is styled with a black background color and gradient. The styling is, of course, done with CSS:
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">${html}</pii:code>

<h3>Expose configuration</h3>

<p>
	We have tweaked quite a lot of the configuration variables and each one is commented. We have also set two callback functions <samp>onBeforeClose</samp> and <samp>onBeforeLoad</samp> to achieve the magenta colored "flash" effect when the exposing closes. Note that the player is paused when the exposing is closed. Upon construction, the <a href="${jqt}/expose.html#api">expose API</a> is returned by enabling the <samp>api</samp> variable. We use this variable in the Flowplayer configuration below:
</p>

<pii:code>${expose}</pii:code>

<h3>Flowplayer configuration</h3>

<p>
	Here we call the <samp>load</samp> and <samp>close</samp> methods of the Expose API at the proper places:
</p>

<pii:code>${js}</pii:code>
