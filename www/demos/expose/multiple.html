<p>
	This page contains two exposed elements whose exposing can be controlled with JavaScript buttons. Both exposed elements have different settings for the mask. Note that both exposes can be loaded <em>simultaneously</em>, a very unique feature of this tool.
</p>

<%@ include file="multiple.htm" %>

<h3>HTML for the exposed elements</h3>

<p>
	Exposed elements are simple <samp>DIV</samp>s that are styled with CSS:
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
${html}
</pii:code>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
	Here we initialize the expose tool for the previous <samp>DIV</samp> elements. Both exposes are configured so that the expose API is made availabe by setting the <samp>api</samp> property to <samp>true</samp>. The <samp>lazy</samp> property is enabled so that the exposing effect won't be loaded upon page load. Both exposes are configured with a customized background color:
</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>

<h3>Buttons</h3>

<p>
	Here are the action buttons. The container element has its <samp>z-index</samp> set larger than 9999 so that it is always placed on top of the mask. The buttons simply use the <samp>load</samp> and <samp>close</samp> API methods.
</p>
