<p>
	It's easy to create horizontal accordions with tabs. Just use the built-in <samp>horizontal</samp> effect and a little bit of CSS tweaking. Here is an example:
</p>

<div style="width:600px;margin:25px auto;">
	<%@ include file="accordion-horizontal.htm" %>
</div>

<p>
	Of course, you can create wildly different looks and sizes with CSS and you can set the <samp>event</samp> configuration property to <samp>mouseover</samp> so that the panes are revealed upon mouseover.
</p>

<h3>HTML Coding</h3>

<p>
	Our HTML setup is similar to the <a href="accordion.html">basic accordion setup</a> except that the "headers" are now images:
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
<!-- accordion root -->
<div id="accordion">

	<!-- 1st header and pane -->
	<img src="/img/title/streaminge.png" />
	<div style="width:200px; display:block"> .. pane content .. </div>

	<!-- 2nd header and pane -->
	<img src="/img/title/flash.png" />
	<div> .. pane content ..</div>

	<!-- 3rd header and pane -->
	<img src="/img/title/streaming.png" />
	<div> .. pane content ..</div>

</div>
</pii:code>

<p>
	We are using the CSS file: <a href="${jqt}/css/tabs-accordion-horizontal.css">tabs-accordion-horizontal.css</a> for styling. Note that the initially opened pane must have an <em>inline style</em> declaration for its width and display. The width specifies the pane width when it is opened and the display must be set to <samp>block</samp> so that it is initially visible.
</p>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
	The <samp>tabs</samp> configuration option defines what elements are used as "accordion headers" and we use the built-in sliding effect called "horizontal" that is suitable for horizontal accordions:
</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>
